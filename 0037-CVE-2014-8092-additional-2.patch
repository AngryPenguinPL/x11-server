Subject: dix: GetHosts bounds check using wrong pointer value [CVE-2014-8092
 pt. 6]

GetHosts saves the pointer to allocated memory in *data, and then
wants to bounds-check writes to that region, but was mistakenly using
a bare 'data' instead of '*data'. Also, data is declared as void **,
so we need a cast to turn it into a byte pointer so we can actually do
pointer comparisons.
